        <h2>MTF τ-5 "Samsara"</h2>
        <p>MTF τ-5 (Tau-5), nicknamed "Samsara," is a Mobile Task Force of the SCP Foundation that utilizes experimental weaponry to combat thaumaturgic, magical, and psionic threats. The main combat unit, Samsara Squad, is composed of four cybernetic clones constructed from the flesh of the Lord of Endowments. While technically immortal, these clones can be defeated or destroyed in combat, though they will regenerate at their machine of birth.</p>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, MTF Tau-5 is not just composed of Irantu, Munru, Nanku, and Onru. They only compose Samsara Squad, which serves as the main combat arm, while Rifle Squad and Weapons Squad serve as support for Samsara Squad in the field. HQ Squad directs all other squads from a safe location, serving as the radio operator and issuing orders from command.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Thousands of years after the Lord of Endowments split himself apart, an anomalous research corporation known as Prometheus Labs discovered the body of the Lord. Prometheus scientists discovered that the body's liver contained cells that could endlessly regenerate. Researching these cells resulted in the beginning of Project Samsara, which sought to create immortal warriors out of the Lord's body.</p>
        <p>Prometheus Labs took four volunteers and uploaded their consciousnesses to a computer, hoping to then download them into new bodies that were cloned from the regenerating cells. If one of these cloned bodies was destroyed or damaged, then one could upload the same mind to a fresh body. The project saw the creation of four cyborg warriors, later known as Samsara Squad. However, the Cabal of Nondenominational Clerics stormed Prometheus Labs, raiding the facility, killing the scientists, and destroying the newly-cloned bodies, the four consciousnesses saved to the computer, and the backup copies. Though the facility was destroyed, the machine survived and made four blank templates.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Prometheus Labs suffered another major accident, leading to the organization disbanding. Amil Escamilla, the former technical officer of Project Samsara, was taken in by the SCP Foundation. He led the Foundation to the destroyed facility, where the clones were found. After some evaluation, it was decided that the clones could be effectively used in an MTF, creating MTF Tau-5 "Samsara".</p>
